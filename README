AIM
-------------

The aim of this project is to provide sufficient data for determining boundary
location between fluid columns top on each other. The output is a csv file that
contains alpha values calculated from received signal when sent signal and 
distance are given. In addition, these alpha values of distinct cycles are
compared and the ratio between adjecent alpha values is included into the 
output file. 
In our project, sent and received signal were produced by an AD-IPR-1210 board 
that is controlled independently from this software.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Assuming the input is a series of vector, the function handleL takes one at a
time as argument and do the calculation by the values in that vector; and writes
output into a csv file. Until the environment of the call is running all data 
is put into the same csv. 

Sent signal and distance can be pre-set in configL by changing values of mSent 
and zDistance respectively. The output file is saved into the folder given by
filePath.
